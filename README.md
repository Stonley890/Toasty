# Toasty
### This data pack adds Toasty, a companion that will follow you throughout the world of Minecraft!

There are two versions of this data pack. The _Destructive_ version and the _Non-Destructive_ version. The _Destructive_ version allows Toasty to break blocks and damage all entities. The _Non-Destructive_ version does not allow breaking blocks and toasty may only damage players.
